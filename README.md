## Purpose
- This assignment will help you understand styling with the BEM CSS Model and give you another view of organizing your projects. You will be using SASS to complete this assignment.

## Task
- You must create a very small example of the BEM Model if you feel comfortable with and understand this model
- You must create an entire website with a minimum of 4 pages that will show that you understand the BEM Model
- Your pages must look professional and have at least 4 sections per page. Navigation and footer can be part of the 4 sections

- My example of BEM is on the shop page, where each item is part of a BEM model.

Enjoy!
